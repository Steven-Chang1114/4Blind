# FiatLux

To run the app on your phone, follow the following steps:

## On your phone:
Make sure you installed "Expo" in app store.

## Usage

On PC
1. In Terminal, cd to this folder.
2. Run: npm install
3. Run: expo start
4. You will see a web pops up. Use your camera to scan the QR code at lower-right corner. (aim your camera to it until a window pops up on the top)
5. Wait till the app opens (first time takes about 1 min)

## Troubleshoot:

If have a red screen with big ass long error message, I recommend to try these commands.

1. expo upgrade
- Just choose yes for whatever shows
2. npm update OR npm install

Then redo expo start.
